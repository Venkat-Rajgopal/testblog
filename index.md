I graduated in "Applied Mathematics" where in my master thesis *"Deep learning based classification of liquids using ultrasound sensor system data"* i worked on applying Deep Learning methods to classify liquid patterns. I continued my work with Ultrasound Signals and Brain pattern recognition @ [Sonovum - Leipzig](https://www.sonovum.de/). 

I am now a Consulting Data Scientist focusing on end to end Data Science solutions based out of Hamburg, Germany. I grew up in Mumbai, India where i had completed my undergrad in Statistics.

Discovering new places on the bike and bouldering has been a nice get away.

80's Thrash Metal has been a huge inluence on me. I am a huge admirer of some of the really talanted Indian Folk and Metal bands ([Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_(band)),  [Kryptos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos_(band))). 

Having brought up in India, it is normal to speak multiple languages. I speak 6 languages. Professionally i communicate in English and German.
