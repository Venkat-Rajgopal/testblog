So far on this blog, all posts were written using Markdown. Markdown is very easy and learnable even for novices like me, but an issue I had was the inconvenience of integrating texts, code, and figures organically in one coherent file. That is why I decided to experiment with Jupyter Notebook, which I had meant to use and learn for a very long time.

In this post, we will test the functionality of Jupyter Notebook by trying out various visualization tools available in Python. In the next post, I will introduce the method I utilized toconvert this `.ipynb` file into `.md` format to display it on our static website.


```python
# A classic opener
print("Hello world")
```

    Hello world


We can also use libraries to create visualizations. Shown below is a simple representation of a sine graph created using `numpy` and `matplotlib`.


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

x = np.linspace(0, 5, 10)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.style.use("seaborn")
plt.plot(x, y, color="skyblue", label="Sine")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Let's step up the game a bit. Here is a simple experimentation with subplots with the `matplotlib` package again.


```python
from scipy.stats import beta

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2)  

ax[0][0].plot([1,2,3,4], color="skyblue")
ax[0][1].plot(np.random.randn(5, 10), np.random.randn(5,10), "mo--")
ax[1][0].plot(np.linspace(0, 5), np.cos(2 * np.pi * np.linspace(0, 5)), color="lime")
ax[1][1].plot(np.linspace(0, 1, 100), beta.pdf(np.linspace(0, 1, 100), 2, 5), color="gold")

plt.show()
```

Next, we use `pandas` to see if basic spreadsheet functionalities can be displayed on Jupyter.


```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(5, 5))

print(df.head())
```

              0         1         2         3         4
    0 -0.119558 -0.632469 -2.176383 -0.310280 -0.480731
    1  0.285325  0.184601  0.808425  0.191247 -0.562904
    2 -0.305665  2.057085  0.191773  0.217347  0.713348
    3 -0.608312 -0.028068  0.222626  0.760257 -1.193710
    4  0.627122 -1.325584  0.504316 -0.079908 -0.051234


We can visualize this toy data using the `pandas.plot` function, much like we created visualizations with `matplotlib` above.


```python
df.plot(kind='barh')
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a1ceabdd0>

`seaborn` is another powerful data visualization framework. It is based off of `matplotlib`, but `seaborn` also contains graphing functionalities that its parent does not, such as heatmaps. 


```python
import seaborn as sns

flights = sns.load_dataset("flights")
flights = flights.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")
ax = sns.heatmap(flights, annot=False, fmt="d")
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.ylabel("Year")
plt.show()
```

Pair plots are used to visualize multidimensional data. We can see pair plots in action by using the `seaborn.pairplot` function. Below are visualizations created using one of `seaborn`'s default data set.


```python
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")
sns.pairplot(iris, hue="species", markers=["o", "s", "D"], palette="husl")
plt.show()
```

`seaborn` also contains a joint plot graphing functionality that allows us to group multiple graphs into one compact figure, as demonstrated below.


```python
sns.jointplot(x="sepal_length", y="sepal_width", data=iris, kind="kde", space=0, color="skyblue")
plt.show()
```

The last example we will take a look at is the `lineplot` in `seaborn`. `lineplot`s are used when there is a lot of noise in the data. 


```python
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 50)
data = np.sin(x) + np.random.rand(5, 50)
df = pd.DataFrame(data).melt()
sns.lineplot(x="variable", y="value", data=df, color="skyblue")
plt.show()
```

This is a quick check to see if equations can properly be displayed on Jupyter using Mathjax.

$$
\begin{equation*}
P(E)   = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k}
\end{equation*}
$$

Here is the cross product formula (which I barely recall from MATH 120).

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 =  \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} & 0 \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation*}
$$


This is enough Jupyter for today! Once I fully familiarize myself with Jupyter, perhaps I will write more posts using this platform.
